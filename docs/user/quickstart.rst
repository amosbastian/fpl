Quickstart
==========

.. module:: fpl

This part of the user guide will try to make it a bit more easy for
users to get started with using **fpl**! Before starting, make sure that
**fpl** is :ref:`installed and up to date <installation>`.

Using the FPL class
-------------------

The :class:`FPL <fpl.FPL>` class is the main way you will be accessing
information from the Fantasy Premier League's API.

Begin by importing the :class:`FPL <fpl.FPL>` class from **fpl**::

    >>> from fpl import FPL

Because **fpl** uses `aiohttp <https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_,
we must also import this and pass a `Client Session <https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/client_advanced.html>`_
as an argument to the `FPL` class. You can either create a session and pass it like this::

    >>> import aiohttp
    >>>
    >>> async def main():
    ...     session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
    ...     fpl = FPL(session)
            # ...
    ...     await session.close()

or use a session context manager::

    >>> async def main():
    ...     async with aiohttp.ClientSession as session:
    ...         fpl = FPL(session)
    ...         # ...

Now, let's try to get a player. For this example, let's get Manchester United's
star midfielder Paul Pogba (replace `# ...` with this code)::

    >>> player = await fpl.get_player(302)
    >>> print(player)
    Pogba - Midfielder - Man Utd

Now, we have a :class:`Player <fpl.models.player.Player>` object called
``player``. We can get all the information we need from this object. For
example, if we want his points per game, or his total points, then we can
simply do this::

    >>> print(player.points_per_game)
    5.7
    >>> print(player.total_points)
    113

Nearly all of :class:`FPL <fpl.FPL>`'s functions include the argument
``return_json`` - if you want to get a ``dict`` instead of e.g. a
:class:`Player <fpl.models.player.Player>` object, then you can simply do the
following::

    >>> player = await fpl.get_player(302, return_json=True)
    >>> print(player["total_points"])
    113

Nice, right? However, one important thing was left out. Because **fpl** is
asynchronous, you must use ``asyncio`` to run the function::

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> asyncio.run(main())


Authentication
--------------

Some of the Fantasy Premier League's API endpoints require the user to be
logged in. For example, the endpoint for `my team <https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/my-team/3808385/>`_)
will return::

    {"detail":"Authentication credentials were not provided."}

since you aren't logged in to my account. To still allow **fpl** users to
access this, the ``login`` function was added to :class:`FPL <fpl.FPL>`. It
must be called before using other functions where login authentication is
required. Let's use my team as an example::

    >>> import asyncio
    >>> import aiohttp
    >>> from fpl import FPL
    >>>
    >>> async def my_team(user_id):
    ...     async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
    ...         fpl = FPL(session)
    ...         await fpl.login()
    ...         user = await fpl.get_user(user_id)
    ...         team = await user.get_team()
    ...     print(team)
    ...
    >>> asyncio.run(my_team(3808385))
    [{'can_sub': True, 'has_played': False, 'is_sub': False, 'can_captain': True, 'selling_price': 46, 'multiplier': 1, 'is_captain': False, 'is_vice_captain': False, 'position': 1, 'element': 400}, ..., {'can_sub': True, 'has_played': False, 'is_sub': True, 'can_captain': True, 'selling_price': 44, 'multiplier': 1, 'is_captain': False, 'is_vice_captain': False, 'position': 15, 'element': 201}]
